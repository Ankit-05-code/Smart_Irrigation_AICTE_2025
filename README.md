# Smart_Irrigation_AICTE_2025

   Smart irrigation systems utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to optimize water usage in agriculture. These systems:

   ⁍ Analyze sensor data: Collecting data on soil moisture, temperature, and weather conditions.
   ⁍ Predict water needs: Using ML algorithms to predict crop water requirements.
   ⁍ Automate irrigation: Adjusting watering schedules and amounts based on real-time data and predictions.

# Benefits:

   ⁍ Water conservation
   ⁍ Increased crop yields
   ⁍ Reduced energy consumption
   ⁍ Improved decision-making
